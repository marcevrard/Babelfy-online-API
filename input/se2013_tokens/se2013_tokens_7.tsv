this	x

in	x

followed	x

<eos>	x
Part	n
of	x
the	x
debate	n

in	x
the	x
related	j
case	n
is	v
caused	x
by	x
the	x
fact	n
that	x
has	x
been	v
carried	x
out	x
by	x
team	n
of	x
the	x
Real Madrid	x
organization	n
(	x
that	x
in	x
its	x
hymn	n
presumes	x
of	x
nobility	n
and	x
honor	n
,	x
and	x
that	x
has	x

its	x
players	n
for	x
analogous	j
acts	n
)	x
and	x
by	x
the	x
dramatization	n
orchestrated	x
,	x
apparently	r
,	x
by	x
Mourinho	x
,	x
who	x
adds	x
one	x
more	j
to	x
his	x
expanded	j
history	n
of	x
histrionic	j
and	x
provoking	j
technician	n
<eos>	x
Anyway	r
,	x
the	x
debate	n
deals	x
with	x
if	x
that	x
type	n
of	x
behavior	n
not	r
prohibited	x
specifically	r
by	x
the	x
regulation	n
contradicts	x
the	x
principles	n
of	x
the	x
sport	n
,	x
that	x
is	v
to	x
say	x
,	x
if	x
with	x
these	x
actions	n
fraud	n
is	v
committed	x
;	x
then	r
,	x
indeed	r
,	x
they	x
are	v
respectful	j
actions	n
with	x
the	x
sport	n
regulation	n
,	x
but	x
they	x
seem	x
to	x
elude	x
its	x
sense	n
<eos>	x
The	x
matter	n
examines	x
the	x
type	n
of	x
damage	n
that	x
is	v
brought	x
to	x
the	x
sporting	j
spirit	n
<eos>	x
One	x
of	x
the	x
advantages	n
that	x
include	x
the	x
sport	n
spirit	n
is	v
the	x
physical	j
integrity	n
of	x
the	x
opposite	j
players	n
,	x
aspect	n
that	x
with	x
these	x
actions	n
was	v
n't	r
put	x
into	x
danger	n
,	x
that	x
is	v
to	x
say	x
,	x
there	x
was	v
no	x
violent	j
game	n
<eos>	x
Another	x
of	x
these	x
advantages	n
to	x
which	x
it	x
is	v
alluded	x
to	x
with	x
the	x
fare-play	n
is	v
to	x
avoid	x
that	x
the	x
team	n
of	x
the	x
lawbreaker	n
players	n
takes	x
advantage	n
unjustly	r
of	x
the	x
opposite	j
team	n
,	x
which	x
did	x
not	r
happen	x
either	r
<eos>	x
However	r
,	x
the	x
paradoxical	j
thing	n
about	x
the	x
action	n
of	x
the	x
players	n
of	x
Real Madrid	x
is	v
that	x
it	x
did	x
not	r
comply	x
to	x
what	x
we	x
normally	r
characterize	x
as	x
legal fraud	x
,	x
because	x
the	x
violation	n
of	x
the	x
rules	n
was	v
not	r
made	x
secretly	r
as	r
to	x
try	x
to	x
avoid	x
the	x
sanction	n
,	x
but	x
their	x
action	n
was	v
most	r
evident	j
and	x
thus	r
they	x
received	x
punishment	n
from	x
the	x
referee	n
<eos>	x
They	x
waited	x
for	x
and	x
accepted	x
the	x
sanction	n
with	x
no	x
complaints	n
<eos>	x
Another	x
question	n
is	v
what	x
type	n
of	x
advantage	n
the	x
violators	n
obtained	x
in	x
the	x
actions	n
deliberately	r
carried	x
out	x
<eos>	x
Here	r
it	x
seems	x
necessary	j
to	x
state	x
that	x
it	x
is	v
n't	r
a	x
disadvantageous	j
situation	n
for	x
rival	n
nor	x
is	v
an	x
obtained	x
benefit	n
in	x
the	x
same	j
game	n
,	x
because	x
evidently	r
the	x
result	n
of	x
the	x
action	n
supposes	x
leaving	x
their	x
own	j
team	n
with	x
less	j
players	n
<eos>	x
And	x
neither	x
is	v
it	x
a	x
useful	j
strategy	n
for	x
the	x
next	j
game	n
,	x
because	x
the	x
club	n
will	x
not	r
be	v
able	j
to	x
count	x
on	x
those	x
players	n
<eos>	x
The	x
advantage	n
,	x
obviously	r
,	x
consists	x
in	x
the	x
fact	n
that	x
the	x
players	n
will	x
begin	x
the	x
following	x
phase	n
of	x
the	x
Championship	n
without	x
cards	n
that	x
could	x
threaten	x
their	x
participation	n
in	x
a	x
future	j
game	n
<eos>	x
But	x
it	x
is	v
about	r
a	x
long	j
term	n
advantage	n
,	x
with	x
a	x
certain	j
degree	n
of	x
indetermination	n
,	x
because	x
the	x
team	n
can	x
be	v
eliminated	x
first	r
of	x
change	n
,	x
and	x
in	x
addition	n
with	x
this	x
action	n
the	x
players	n
fulfil	x
a	x
sanction	n
game	n
and	x
go	x
to	x
the	x
second	j
cycle	n
of	x
cards	n
,	x
in	x
which	x
the	x
suspension	n
by	x
card	n
accumulation	n
takes	x
place	n
with	x
one	x
less	j
than	x
in	x
the	x
first	j
cycle	n
<eos>	x
So	r
that	x
,	x
by	x
passing	x
rounds	n
,	x
it	x
is	v
not	r
so	r
clear	j
that	x
it	x
is	v
an	x
advantage	n
<eos>	x
Those	x
actions	n
are	v
really	r
against	x
the	x
sporting	j
spirit	n
,	x
which	x
is	v
part	n
of	x
the	x
strategic	j
decisions	n
that	x
favor	x
taking	x
advantages	n
allowed	x
by	x
the	x
rules	n
<eos>	x
Regarding	x
this	x
assumption	n
,	x
the	x
players	n
did	x
not	r
act	x
in	x
order	n
to	x
avoid	x
the	x
application	n
of	x
the	x
sanction	n
(	x
this	x
would	x
have	x
been	v
a	x
clear	j
case	n
of	x
legal fraud	x
)	x
,	x
but	x
rather	r
chosen	x
when	r
to	x
obey	x
it	x
<eos>	x
They	x
made	x
a	x
strategic	j
decision	n
without	x
avoiding	x
the	x
punishment	n
<eos>	x
Although	x
the	x
border	n
between	x
the	x
wittiness	n
and	x
the	x
law	n
fraud	n
is	v
diffuse	j
,	x
in	x
this	x
occasion	n
I	x
believe	x
it	x
was	v
a	x
clear	j
case	n
of	x
wittiness	n
<eos>	x
The	x
controversy	n
seems	x
to	x
arise	x
from	x
two	x
factors	n
:	x
because	x
it	x
was	v
about	r
two	x
auto	j
expulsions	n
and	x
the	x
way	n
the	x
transmission	n
of	x
the	x
directive	n
was	v
carried	x
out	x
to	x
cause	x
them	x
<eos>	x
The	x
damage	n
brought	x
about	r
to	x
the	x
principles	n
of	x
the	x
sport	n
by	x
these	x
actions	n
is	v
not	r
as	r
much	r
ethical	j
as	x
aesthetic	j
<eos>	x
