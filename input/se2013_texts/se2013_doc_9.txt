routine Support for democracy in Latin America continues to edge up , as does backing for private enterprise . Crime has become a bigger worry than unemployment . And Brazil is seen as more influential than the United States across much of the region . Those are some of the findings of the latest Latinobarómetro poll taken in <number> countries and published exclusively by The Economist . Because the poll has been taken regularly since <number> , it tracks changes in attitude across the region . Two related things stand out in the results of this year 's poll , taken in September and early October . The first is Latin America 's fairly sunny mood . The second is the increasing stability of attitudes towards democracy and its core institutions . Support for democracy has risen noticeably in several countries on the Pacific rim of South America ( see table <number> ) . For example in Peru , where economic growth has averaged <number> % a year since <number> , support for democracy has risen from a low of <number> % in <number> to <number> % this year . It also rose in Mexico , where the economy has recovered after suffering a big drop in output last year . But only around half of respondents in Mexico and Brazil , the region 's two most populous countries , are convinced democrats , which drags down the regional average ( see chart <number> ) . Some <number> % of respondents across the region pronounced themselves satisfied with how their country 's democracy works in practice , the same figure as last year but a big increase on the <number> % in <number> ( chart <number> ) . Some <number> % said they had confidence in their country 's Congress and <number> % in their government , the same as last year in both cases but up sharply from <number> ( <number> % and <number> % respectively ) . A decade ago economic woes in Latin America undermined support for democracy . That it has held up during the world financial crisis is probably because many Latin American countries suffered only a brief recession and have enjoyed a strong recovery . In addition , a stronger social safety net has helped to shield the poor . ( The United Nations ' Economic Commission for Latin America reported this week that the proportion of Latin Americans living in poverty rose only marginally in <number> and has fallen again this year , to <number> % . -RRB- But the mood varies widely from country to country ( see chart <number> ) . Brazil 's strong economic performance and the popularity of its outgoing president , Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva , is reflected in a widely shared sense of progress . That is scarcer in Mexico and Central America , where the recession was more severe and violent crime has worsened . For only the second time since the polls began , more respondents across Latin America as a whole cite crime , rather than unemployment , as the most important problem facing their country ( see chart <number> ) . Some <number> % say that either they or a close relative have been victims of crime over the past year , but that is down from <number> % last year and is the lowest figure since <number> . A more robust economic performance is reflected in rising support for private enterprise and the market economy : some <number> % of respondents across the region say that private enterprise is indispensable for development , up from <number> % in <number> ( see chart <number> ) . Some <number> % agree that the market economy is the only system that will make their country developed , up from <number> % last year . Interestingly , <number> % of respondents in Venezuela hold that view ( and <number> % there back private enterprise ) even though their left-wing president , Hugo Chávez , is expropriating many private companies . Brazil is the country which exercises most leadership in the region , mentioned by <number> % of respondents ( up from <number> % last year ) , followed by the United States ( <number> % , unchanged from last year ) and Venezuela ( <number> % , down from <number> % last year ) . But the United States is seen as the most influential country by respondents in Mexico and much of Central America , whereas Venezuela enjoys that distinction in Ecuador , the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua .
